# About

This is a little project that allows livestream chat to interact more with the person who is streaming with an easy to use GUI base system

Currently i am just testing around and doing stuff before i patch things up a little nicer and comment on what does what. If i were to give a guess on a first proper file release that would be early 2021

# Note

This does use GSON and that is planned to be the only one due to the lack of an inbuilt JSON parser. This is to allow saving, loading and distributing of user actions.
